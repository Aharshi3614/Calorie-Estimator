# Calorie-Estimator
This project is an AI-powered Calorie Estimator that predicts the calorie content of food items based on the food name and serving size.
It uses machine learning and deep learning techniques along with a user-friendly web app interface for real-time predictions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data preprocessing, NLP, deep learning models, and app deployment can be combined to solve a real-world health and fitness problem.
